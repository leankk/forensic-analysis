# Script for Forensic Analysis

This is a basic tool for forensic analysis of a machine running the Linux operating system.
With this tool, you can extract some data from the machine, such as information about the processor, RAM, etc.

# How to use

To run it, open the terminal in the directory and use the command line ** ./script-for-forensic-analysis.sh**. &nbsp
**Obs:** To be able to send the data to a USB stick, you will need to change the responsible directory in the $OUTDIR variable. &nbsp
**Example: ** &nbsp
```$OUTDIR='/mnt/*usb_directory_name*'```
